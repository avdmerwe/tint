Description: Almost exact clone of the original Tetris game
 This is TINT which stands for TINT Is Not Tetris(tm).
 .
 As the title suggests, this is a clone of the original tetris game
 written by Alexey Pajitnov, Dmitry Pavlovsky, and Vadim Gerasimov.
 .
 I've tried to keep the game as close to the original as possible, but
 there are a few differences. Nevertheless, it's probably the closest
 to the original that you'll ever find in the UNIX world...
